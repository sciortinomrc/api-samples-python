A set of sample calls to the Meterian API in Python: use simple python scripts to leverage the power of the [Meterian API](http://api.meterian.io)

## You will need a token to use these tools!

All these tools will require an API token from Meterian. This is available for any paid plan, and it can be generated at  https://meterian.com/account/#tokens

Once you have the token, the best and secure way to use it is to put it into an environment variable, called METERIAN_API_TOKEN. In linux, for example, you can simply do something like this:

    export METERIAN_API_TOKEN=a902874d-50f2-464f-8707-780cd5f669a3
(no, this is not a real token eheh!)

In most of the commands however you can simply specify the token on the command line using something like this:

    ./yadda.py --token=a902874d-50f2-464f-8707-780cd5f669a3

# Tools

## license&#46;py
This script allows you to list the licenses of a component across [the platforms managed by Meterian](https://www.meterian.com/integrations.html#languages) . Simply specify the language, the full name of the library and the version: the tool will let you know the licenses found. Sometime it's instant, sometimes it may take a couple of seconds: do not worry, a result will eventually come :)

## vulninfo&#46;py
This script allows you to list information regarding a specific vulnerability across Meterian curated advisories databases (php, nvd, gha). Simply specify the latter database and the unique identifer for a given vulnerability and the tool will fetch relevant information about it.

## advisories&#46;py
This script allows to list the advisories of associated to a given library. After specifying the language, the full name fo the library and its version, the tool will fetch all the related advisories it can find.

Asking for **dotnet** library, **System.Text.RegularExpressions**, version **4.3.0**

## Help
If in need of help issue the `--help` flag (all the listed tools support it).

    $ ./license.py --help
    usage: license.py [-h] [-t API-TOKEN] [-l LOGLEVEL] language name version

    positional arguments:
      language              The language of the library (i.e. java) ['java',
                            'javascript', 'nodejs', 'python', 'dotnet', 'ruby',
                            'scala', 'php', 'swift', 'golang']
      name                  The full name of the library (i.e.
                            com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind)
      version               The version of the library (i.e. 2.8.8)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t API-TOKEN, --token API-TOKEN
                            Allows you to specify the API token to use directly on
                            the command line. You can create your token with a
                            bootstrap+ plan at
                            https://meterian.com/account/#tokens
      -l LOGLEVEL, --log LOGLEVEL
                            Sets the logging level (default is warning)


# Other general information
## Common parameters
As a common beheaviour across all the tools, it's also possible to specify the log level with any tool using  soething like this:

    ./yadda.py --log=DEBUG
Beware: the DEBUG level can be very verbose!


## What's more?
Well. you can build your onw tool using the Meterian API at https://api.meterian.io and you can also contribute to this repository!
